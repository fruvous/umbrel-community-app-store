  NetBird is a secure networking platform that creates private, peer-to-peer connections between devices using encrypted communication channels. It builds a trusted network layer that allows seamless and direct communication without exposing data to intermediaries. Every connection is protected with modern encryption standards and managed automatically through a zero trust security model that authenticates identities rather than networks.


  The NetBird Client is the component that brings this system to life. It handles all encrypted communication, key management, and access control between connected peers. Once active, it securely links the device to the NetBird network and continuously manages all background operations to maintain a reliable and private connection.


  By combining simplicity, automation, and strong cryptography, the NetBird Client enables secure networking without configuration. It provides a stable foundation for private communication and collaboration while ensuring that every connection remains fully encrypted, authenticated, and resilient.

releaseNotes: >-
  This version introduces several updates and refinements to the NetBird client and management components. The deprecated gRPC client code has been replaced, DNS forwarding has been improved, and network monitoring on macOS has been extended with wakeup detection for better responsiveness.


  The client now clamps MSS on outbound traffic, improves compatibility with nftables by allowing INPUT traffic on the compat filter table, and ensures cleaner shutdown behavior across all subsystems. These changes enhance both performance and reliability during network transitions.


  Additional improvements include the addition of a login hint for OIDC authentication flows, DNS configuration data in debug bundles, and a refined database connection lifecycle configuration within the management service. Together, these updates strengthen stability, connectivity, and observability across the platform.
